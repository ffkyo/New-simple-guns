To save the provided files and make the website work correctly, follow these steps:

Create a new folder: Make a new folder on your computer, for example, MyWebsite.

Save the HTML file:

Open a text editor (like Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on macOS, or VS Code, Sublime Text).
Copy the entire content of the TEST.html file.
Paste it into the empty text editor.
Save the file as index.html inside the MyWebsite folder. Make sure the file extension is .html.
Save the JavaScript file:

Open another empty text editor or a new tab in your current editor.
Copy the entire content of the script.js file.
Paste it into this text editor.
Save the file as script.js inside the same MyWebsite folder.
Create the assets folder (optional, but recommended):

Inside the MyWebsite folder, create a new subfolder named assets. This is important because the HTML file references a font in this folder (assets/Angel_wish.ttf).
Download and place the font in the assets folder:

The HTML code refers to the Angel_wish.ttf font. You will need to find and download this font. If you don't have it, you can search for it online or use a placeholder font until you have the correct one.
Once you have the Angel_wish.ttf file, place it in the assets folder you created in step 4.
Summary of the folder structure:

MyWebsite/
├── index.html
├── script.js
└── assets/
    └── Angel_wish.ttf (You need to download and place this file here)
How to open the website:

After saving all files as described:

Navigate to the MyWebsite folder.
Double-click the index.html file.
This should open the website in your default web browser.

Important notes:

Internet Connection: The website uses external resources (videos, images, and audio from catbox.moe, as well as the GSAP library from cdnjs.cloudflare.com). Make sure you have an active internet connection so these resources can be loaded.
Browser Compatibility: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) should display the website correctly.
Autoplay Policies: Some browsers have strict autoplay policies for media (especially audio). The start-screen is designed to capture user interaction before media playback to bypass these policies. If you experience issues with media playback, it's likely due to your browser blocking automatic playback until you click or tap on the screen.
